# User Guide

WitFoo Analytics provides a unified interface for security operations — from artifact search and incident investigation to compliance reporting and threat intelligence.

## Modules

### [Signals](signals/index.md)

Search, filter, and investigate security artifacts. Configure lead rules for automatic incident creation and classification rules for severity assignment.

### [Graph](graph/index.md)

Explore the relationship graph built from correlated artifacts. Nodes represent entities (IPs, domains, users) and edges represent observed relationships between them.

### [Observer](observer/index.md)

Track analyst work through work units, organize investigations into work collections, define modus operandi (MO) patterns, and record observations for institutional knowledge.

### [Reporter](reporter/index.md)

Generate executive reports covering compliance readiness, tool effectiveness, and cost/savings analysis. Date-range filtering and CSV export for all report data.

### [CyberGrid](cybergrid/index.md)

Subscribe to and publish threat intelligence feeds. Manage intelligence jobs, browse the threat intelligence library, and share indicators across organizations.

### [Health](health/index.md)

Monitor system health with real-time container metrics, historical performance data, and configurable alert rules for CPU, memory, disk, and service availability.

## Navigation

Use the top navigation bar to switch between modules. The sidebar within each module provides access to sub-pages. Your available modules depend on your assigned [role](../admin-guide/roles.md) and the deployment's [UI module configuration](../deployment/configuration.md).
