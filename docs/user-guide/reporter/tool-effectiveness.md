# Tool Effectiveness

Analyzes how security products contribute to incident detection and response.

## Sankey Flow Diagram

Shows artifact flows from products through types to incident severities. Products ranked by artifact count, top-N shown individually, remainder as "Other".

## Product Coverage Venn

Overlap between security products. 1-4 products use fixed geometric layouts; 5-8 use radial layout.
